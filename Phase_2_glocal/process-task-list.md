Task List Management
Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

Task Implementation
One sub-task at a time: Do NOT start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
Completion protocol:
When you finish a sub‑task, immediately mark it as completed by changing [ ] to [x].
If all subtasks underneath a parent task are now [x], follow this sequence:
First: Run the full test suite (pytest, npm test, bin/rails test, etc.)
Only if all tests pass: Stage changes (git add .)
Clean up: Remove any temporary files and temporary code before committing
Commit: Use a descriptive commit message that:
Uses conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.)

Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent task

Lists key changes and additions

References the task number and PRD context

Formats the message as a single-line command using -m flags, e.g.:

git commit -m "feat: add payment validation logic" -m "- Validates card type and expiry" -m "- Adds unit tests for edge cases" -m "Related to T123 in PRD"
Once all the subtasks are marked completed and changes have been committed, mark the parent task as completed.
Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.
Task List Maintenance
Update the task list as you work:

Mark tasks and subtasks as completed ([x]) per the protocol above.
Add new tasks as they emerge.
Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:

List every file created or modified.
Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.
AI Instructions
When working with task lists, the AI must:

Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
Follow the completion protocol:
Mark each finished sub‑task [x].
Mark the parent task [x] once all its subtasks are [x].
Add newly discovered tasks.
Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
