Product Requirements Document: Theglocal (MVP)
Feature Name: Theglocal - Local Community & Creator Platform

Version: 1.0 (MVP)

Date: 2025-10-06

1. Introduction/Overview
Theglocal is a hyper-local mobile and web application designed to be a virtual town square where local populations can connect, share information, and engage with their community, all while maintaining user anonymity. The platform combines the core features of a community forum (like Reddit) with a marketplace for booking local artists and creators (like BookMyShow). This initial version (MVP) will focus on establishing the core pillars: anonymous communities, location-based news aggregation, and the artist discovery/booking platform.

2. Goals
Launch a functional MVP with the three core features: Communities, News, and Artist Booking.

Provide a seamless, location-aware content feed for users upon first launch.

Establish a secure and reliable system for artists to register, subscribe, and be booked.

Create a simple and effective content moderation system for community and platform admins.

3. User Stories
As a General Resident (Anonymous User)...
I want to sign up anonymously (using only an email/username) so that I can participate without revealing my real identity.

I want the app to automatically use my location to show me relevant posts, news, and events nearby so that my feed is always relevant.

I want to join a community for my neighborhood so that I can discuss local happenings.

I want to share a post (text or image) in a community to ask questions or share information.

I want to browse and discover local artists/creators so that I can hire them for an event.

I want to book an artist through the platform securely, knowing my public identity remains anonymous during the process.

As an Artist/Creator...
I want to create a public profile with my name, services, portfolio, and contact information so that users can discover me.

I want to pay a monthly subscription (500 INR) to keep my profile active and listed on the platform.

I want to receive booking requests from users and manage them through a dashboard.

I want to create "event" pages to promote my upcoming performances, which users can then discuss.

As a Community Admin...
I want to be automatically assigned as an admin for the community I create.

I want to review content that has been reported by other users in my community.

I want to have the ability to remove posts or comments that violate community guidelines.

I want to be able to add other users as admins to help me moderate.

As a Super Admin...
I want a dashboard to view and manage all users, artists, and community admins to ensure the platform is healthy and safe.

I want to be able to resolve moderation disputes and take action on any user or content on the platform.

4. Functional Requirements
FR-01: User & Identity System
Anonymous User Accounts: Users must be able to create an account with a username and password, without needing to provide a real name or photo.

Artist Accounts: A user account can be converted to an "Artist" account.

Artist Profiles: Artist profiles must be public and include fields for a real name/stage name, service description, photo gallery, location, and rates.

Super Admin Role: There must be a distinct "Super Admin" role with platform-wide privileges accessible via a separate dashboard.

FR-02: Community & Content
Create Community: Any user can create a new community. The creator automatically becomes the admin.

Join/Leave Community: Users can join and leave communities.

Create Post: Users can create posts within a community. Posts can contain a title, text body, and one optional image.

Comment on Post: Users can comment on posts.

Location-Based Feed: The main feed must be a mix of posts from a user's joined communities and aggregated news, prioritized by the user's physical location. The app must request location permissions upon first use.

FR-03: News Aggregation
The system must integrate with the Google News API to fetch news articles.

News articles displayed in the feed must be based on the user's location.

Users should be able to click a news item to read it and have an option to share it as a post within a community.

FR-04: Artist & Booking System
Artist Subscription: Artists must subscribe for 500 INR/month to be listed. Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Razorpay, Stripe) for this. The profile should be hidden/inactive if the subscription lapses.

Artist Discovery: Users must be able to search for and filter artists based on location and category (e.g., "Musician," "Painter").

Booking Request: Users can send a booking request to an artist. The booking flow should handle communication securely.

Artist Events: Artists must be able to create simple event pages (Title, Date, Description, Location). These pages will have a discussion/comment section for logged-in users.

FR-05: Moderation
Report Content: Any logged-in user can report a post or comment.

Flagging: When content is reported, it should be flagged in the system. The content remains visible to the public.

Admin Notification: A notification/entry for the reported content must appear in both the relevant Community Admin's dashboard and the Super Admin's dashboard.

Admin Actions: Admins must have the ability to "Remove Content" or "Dismiss Report".

5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope for MVP)
One-on-one anonymous chat between users.

A polling system for local issues.

Tagging government authorities in posts.

Advanced user analytics or dashboards for artists.

Integration with Reddit or BookMyShow APIs (we will focus on Google News first).

Users enabling/disabling their exact location (for MVP, location is mandatory for the core experience).

6. Design Considerations
Look & Feel: The UI should be minimalist, clean, and modern, drawing inspiration from platforms like X (formerly Twitter).

Responsiveness: The design must be fully responsive and provide an excellent experience on both mobile devices and web browsers.

Key Screens: Prioritize the design for:

The main location-based feed.

The community page (post list).

The post detail/comment view.

The artist search/discovery page.

The artist profile page.

7. Technical Considerations
Scalability: The backend architecture should be designed to support millions of users.

Geolocation: The system must efficiently handle and query user location data to power the feed.

API Integration: The backend will need robust integration with the Google News API.

Payment Gateway: A secure and reliable payment gateway must be integrated to handle artist subscriptions.

8. Success Metrics
Number of Daily Active Users (DAU).

Number of new communities created per week.

Average number of posts and comments per active user.

Number of registered and subscribed artists.

Number of booking requests initiated per month.
